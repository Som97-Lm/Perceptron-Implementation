# Perceptron Implementation — From Scratch Neural Network

This repository contains a complete implementation of the **Perceptron**, one of the earliest neural network algorithms.  
The notebook builds the perceptron from first principles: weight initialization, forward pass, training loop, error updates, and decision boundary visualization.

This is an excellent foundational exercise before learning modern neural networks (MLP, CNNs, etc.).

## Notebook Included
- **Neural_net_perceptron.ipynb**

This notebook demonstrates:
- What a perceptron is and how it works  
- Weight initialization  
- Activation function (step function)  
- Perceptron update rule  
- Full training loop implementation  
- Classification on toy datasets  
- Visualizing decision boundaries  
- Understanding linearly separable vs non-separable data  

---

## 🎯 Objective
To provide deep foundational understanding of neural network basics through:
- Manual implementation (no Scikit-Learn)  
- Visualization of how weights change during training  
- Seeing how a simple neural model can classify data  
- Preparing the foundation for MLPs and gradient-based learning  

This notebook helps bridge the gap between classical ML and modern deep learning.
